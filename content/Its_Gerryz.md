Hello there! My Actual name is Gerasimos! (But you can call me Gerry for short!) Im an artist that has a somewhat wide range of skills:
* **Modeling:** Long experience with 3D modeling. I can model pretty much anything. (I may have a hard time with really hard models to make, but i havent found myself often, if ever, in that positioin). Included in this, i can also do very optimized UV unwrapping! (I have the patience for it!)
* **Sculpting:** I can sculpt in 3D, altho i dont have much of an experience at it! (I do have a little bit of experience, but not much)
* **Texturing:** I can add textures to a model with UVs. I can make full PBR textures if needed.
* **Painting:** I can paint textures and paintings in my artsyle(s)
* **Animation:** I can rig a 3D character and animate it. I have some experience with it. I can also animate in 2D, through drawing.
(all of these, digitally of course!)

(ill write more soon!)
